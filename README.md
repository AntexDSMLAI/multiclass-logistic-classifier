# Multiclass Logistic Regression Classifier

This project implements a **Multiclass Logistic Regression Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn. The model is trained on the **Heart Disease dataset**, which predicts the presence of heart disease based on multiple features.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a multiclass logistic regression model. We utilize the **Heart Disease dataset** to classify the target variable, which indicates the presence of heart disease. The model uses standard machine learning practices, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation using various metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
